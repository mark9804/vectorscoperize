Vectorscoperize is a macOS app that allows you to capture and analyze the color gamut of your display using a vectorscope (Rec.601) and RGB parade view modes.

## Features

- Switch between vectorscope and RGB parade view modes
- Capture a specific region of the display

## Usage

- Download the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/zhaoluchen/vectorscoperize/releases/latest).
- Unzip the release file, drag to Applications folder.
- Remove quarantine attribute from the app by running `xattr -cr /Applications/Vectorscoperize.app`.
- Start the app. The app will prompt you to select a region of the display you want to capture. After you select a region, the application window will appear.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When the application window is focused or the menubar icon is clicked, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to (re-)select a region of the display
- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> to switch to vectorscope view mode
- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> to switch to RGB parade view mode
- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to show/hide the scopes
- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit the app

## Known Issues

- Random (but persistent) issue: When switching the view mode, application view may not update immediately unless contents in the monitored region are changed.
